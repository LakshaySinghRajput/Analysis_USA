✨ Insights into Discount Strategies and Sales Trends
Key Insights:

Inconsistent Discounting Strategy:

📉 In 2015, low discounts hurt sales and customer retention. We used groupby() and mean() to see how discounts changed year by year.
💡 High discounts in 2014 and 2016 caused confusion, showing that the discount strategy wasn’t clear.
Product-Specific Insights:

🪑 Tables had the highest discount (0.261), but sales were still low (~648.79). This shows that discounts alone don’t guarantee higher sales, even after using pivot_table() to analyze them.
📚 Bookcases & Chairs had good sales with high discounts, showing strong demand.
🛠️ Fasteners & Labels had low sales and low discounts, meaning these products aren't popular.
Regional Insights:

🌍 Central Region: Highest sales (253.39) with higher discounts (0.125), showing that discounts helped increase sales.
🔥 South Region: Strong sales (255.59) without high discounts (0.098), meaning customers in this region don’t need big discounts to buy.
⚖️ East Region: Moderate sales (247.74) and discounts (0.107), meaning discounts had a balanced effect.
❄️ West Region: Lowest sales (230.59) and lowest discounts (0.090), showing weak demand.
Recommendations:

🚩 Tables: High discounts didn’t improve sales much, so pricing or product position might need a rethink.
💡 Discount Strategy: Use plot() and seaborn to check how discounts and sales are linked, to make better pricing decisions.
